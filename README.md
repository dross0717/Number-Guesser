# Number-Guesser

Number Guesser is a random number guessing game to be played between 2 players. You will input a range and update the game with that range, and then both players will guess until the game states that there is a winner!
 
 ## What we learned
 
 Through creating this game, we learned a lot about how to create functions in javascript using if/else statements, local and global variables, event listeners, calling functions within other functions, and much more. We also learned all about git workflow and the wonderful world of git conflicts. We have learned a lot about how to work as a pair and the issues that can arise when mostly dividing and conquering the work. In the future we would have loved to rearrange our working style a bit to try to get further along in the work.
